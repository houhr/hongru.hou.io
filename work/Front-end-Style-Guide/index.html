    <p>By bridging the gap between our design and development teams, I designed, developed and maintained a Front-end Style Guide for Baidu Map’s mobile Web app. It helped increase the consistency of user experience and improved the average page loading speed by 11%.</p>

      <p>Baidu Maps is the most popular maps app in China, and it has hundreds of millions of users. However, in terms of UI/UX, code as well as efficiency, the giant had some problems before we did this project, which we thought could be solved by a front-end style guide:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>Different engineers have different implementation for the same UI elements and it causes different user experience.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>The repetition of developing same UI elements reduced the efficiency of whole team.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Redundant code has negtive impact on page loading speed, which related to CTR(Click-Through Rate) tightly.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>It's extremely hard to maintain the style-related code that at different places.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      </p>
      <p>Aimed at delivering a better user experience and performance, we decided to create a front-end style guide for our Web app. The style guide should target at mobile web, has all the components that we used then and cover all the browsers that in our QA's list. Besides that, it should also be reusable, easily maintainable and conveniently accessible.</p>

      </p>

      <p>After understood problems, set up goals and send out schedule and cost documents, I started the project by did some research about style guides. Actually there were many differnt kinds of style guides — content style guides, brand style guides, UI style guides, development style guides and front-end style guides. Then, I read some books and articles about front-end style guides, and also found some best style guides from companies like Github as great examples.</p>

      <p>Once I knew what we want, I began to do technical research. Which kind of CSS preprocessor should we use? LESS or Sass? Which kind of automation tool should we adopt? Grunt or gulp? These were just a tiny part of all the questions I needed to answer. Since other engineers will use my code after I finish this project, it also important to consider their opinions. </p>

      <p>As project lead, I also collaborated with Product Manager and UI/UX designers at the same time. On one hand, I need to educate them what front-end style guide is. On the other hand, we spend a lot time to decide what UI/UX elements should be included in the style guide. I was quite happy with what we achieved — we deleted 4 background colors (-36.7%), 3 opacity values (-60%), 1 font family (-50%), 4 font sizes (-50%) and 22 colors (-75.9%)! The process not only helped me understand how terrible things were, but also helped designers and manager start to rethink their design process.</p>

      <p>Then, I built style tiles with PM and finished 50% of design and development work with another senior engineer. By mixing KSS, Sass, gulp, fontcustom and other related technology and tools with innovation, the result was better than what we expected.</p>
