    <p>Next Muni is a buses arrival times prediction app for people who commute by Muni daily. Based on your location and search history in different area, this app shows you the right information you need once you open it. Sync to Apple wath gives you more confidence while catching Muni.</p>

      <h2>The Problem</h2>

        <span class="content__method">Competitive Products Analysis</span>
      </p>

      <p>I initiated this app based on my own needs. As a student who lives in San Francisco and commutes by taking Muni buses everyday, I have tried several different bus arrival times prediction apps. However, none of these apps are smart and have enough customized information for individuals. Therefore, <em>people need spend tons of time to interact with the app to find the right information they need</em>.</p>
      <p>The following table shows how many interactions are needed for a single tasks in two mainstream Muni apps and Google Maps.</p>

      <h2>Design Goal</h2>

      <p class="content__methods">
        <span class="content__method"></span>
      </p>
      <p>By doing this project, I would like to simplify the connection between people and the right information they need. So, they could live a more efficient life.</p>
      <p>By grouping and saving the data of where and when people used the app and which Muni routes they searched, we can reduce the time and effort that people needed by guessing their needs base on their search history and location. The ultimate goal is to show people the correct information right after they open the app in their follow up same tasks usage.</p>
      <p>Yes, just one tap. That's my goal.</p>

      <h2>Design Process</h2>

      <p class="content__methods">
        <span class="content__method">User Journey</span>
        <span class="content__method">User Flow</span>
        <span class="content__method">Paper Sketch</span>
        <span class="content__method">Mood Board</span>
      </p>

      <p>The targeted users of bus arrival times prediction apps are people who have a relatively fixed daily routine — go back and forth between home and school or company — and take public transit every weekday. <em>They know which bus they should take and where stations are</em>, or they can get this information from other prepositive apps like Google Maps. However, they don't want to open Google Maps and input departure station and terminal station everytime when they need the time information.</p>
      <p>It's also important to go through the whole process in the shoes of a user new to the app, and try to understand where, when, why and how they use this kind of apps. After having a clear idea of what the interaction logic should be, then I started to sketch some rough ideas on the paper. A mood board with all the themes I wanted to communicate is also necessary to bring the whole idea to life. I even customized the style of maps based on the color palette that generated from the mood board.</p>

      <h2>Iterative Design</h2>

        <span class="content__method">Test Early and Often</span>
        <span class="content__method">Self-criticism</span>
        <span class="content__method">Asking for Feedback</span>
      </p>

      <p>The first version of the design could finish the main part of the job successfully, and the most important thing was that users could find the right information they need in follow up usages (same tasks) — it's only one tap away!</p>
      <p>However, after I showed and tested it with my classmates, it turned out that some of them had some doubts about the app — what does the time mean? And I also got some feedback from a Facebook's HR, he suggested me to think about what the app looks like when users just downloaded it.</p>
      <p>Moreover, after I did something else and came back to look at this version with fresh eyes, I also got some my own idea about how can I improve the app. So, I started to tweak the app and then the second version came out.</p>

    <div class="project__content--with-padding">
      <p>These were multiple changes I made in the second version.</p>
      <p>First of all, I designed a welcome screen for new users. Since they haven't search for any routes yet, showing them some nearby routes may help them get started and keep efficient. And a brief discription of how this app works can also help them get familiar with the app and make the onboarding process more smooth and friendly. </p>
      <p>Second, be inspired by the concept of "nearby routes", I added it to search page right below the search bar. Because of the cost (no matter time or effort) of inputs is much bigger than taps, it could save tons of time if the user could find the targeted routs in the list.</p>
      <p>Third, the contextual user guide also appear when users finished their first "search" or "save" operation, so they know how to edit the item in the list.</p>

      <p>Last but not the least, I redesigned the clock down icon. So, now people can tell the meaning behind the time correctly.</p>

      <h2>Prototyping</h2>

      <p class="content__methods">
        <span class="content__method">High-fidelity Prototype</span>
      </p>

      <p>Until now, I have only finished half of the design work (maybe I should say &beta; version, I know digital products are never finished). There's another half that I would like to finish with code — transition and animation. </p>
      <p>Although I can get a low-fidelity prototype much quicker in Keynote or inVision, code could give me the most precise control that designers who don't have a technical background may not have. Now that transition and animation are all about feelings, there's no reason not to design them as real as possible.</p>

      <h2>Bonus: Another Side</h2>
      <p class="content__methods">
        <span class="content__method">Thinking in Ecosystem</span>
      </p>

      <p>As apps for Google Glass, good Apple watch apps also require small pieces of information that tight to time and location, as well as light and simple interactions. So, I designed following user experience for Apple watch at the end of the project, and I saw this as a practice of thinking in ecosystem.</p>
      <p>If I have more time for this side project, I would like to explor Apple watch app a little bit more. Compared with iPhone apps, Apple watch apps have their own interaction, usage and criteria that can tell the great from the good. How these two apps should coordinate with each other is another question I'd like to answer.</p>
