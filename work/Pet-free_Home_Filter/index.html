    <p>This conceptual project was a response to Airbnb’s design exercise and the idea derived from a one-star review in App
    Store. A research-driven, data-backed design process helped arrive a holistic pet-free home booking experience.</p>

      <h3>Design Challenge Description</h3>

      <q> Reimagine and redesign a digital product of your choice that showcases your skills and abilities to solve a complex
      problem as a designer. You can choose to design for any platform, but keep in mind the challenges that you might face designing for different
      platforms, especially for mobile.</q>

      <h3>Idea Gathering</h3>

      <ol>
        <li>
          <h4>Key Lock Box / Smart Lock Check-in</h4>
          <p>This idea was based on one of my Airbnb experiences in Mexico. The host was out of town and gave the keys to whom I just
          could not find when I arrived.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Smart Home Devices Control Sharing</h4>
          <p>The idea of sharing smart locks control with guests led to the idea of sharing the control of other smart home devices
          to bring the living experience to the next level.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <h4>Pet-free Home Filter</h4>
          <p>After read all the reviews in Apple App Store and Google Play store, I found this invaluable 1-star rating review —</p>

      </ol>

      <h3>Prioritization</h3>
      <p>After comparing the impact and effort of each idea and considering the fact that I only have 5 days, I decided to work
      on the Pet-free home filter.</p>

      <h3>Pet Allergies</h3>

      <p><strong>How many people have pet allergies?</strong>
        <br> 10% of the U.S. population has pet allergies. — webmd.com</p>

      <p><strong>How many homes have pets?</strong>
        <br> In the United States, nearly 40 and 33% of households own dogs and cats, respectively. — Animal Allergens and Their
        Presence in the Environment</p>
      
      <p><strong>How harmful are pet allergies?</strong>
        <br>Typical allergy symptoms range from relatively minor afflictions like watering eyes to more serious reactions such as
        anaphylactic shock, which can start with dizziness and loss of consciousness but may quickly lead to heart failure and
        even death. — Pet Allergies 101</p>
      
      <p><strong>The complexity of pet allergies</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Some people are only allergic to cats</li>
        <li>Others are only allergic to dogs</li>
        <li>Still others are allergic to both</li>
        <li>Few people allergic to other pets</li>

      <h3>Research on Indoor Pet Allergens</h3>

      <p>Indoor pet sensitization rates in general population:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Cat sensitization rates: 12.2%</li>
        <li>Dog sensitization rates: 11.9%</li>
        <li>Rat sensitization rates: 1.4%</li>
        <li>Rat sensitization rates: 1.4%</li>
      </ul>

      <br>
      <h3>Research on Indoor Pet Allergens</h3>
      <p>The correlation between cat allergy and dog allergy is 78% base on the data I found. In other words, 78% of all the
      cat-allergic and dog-allergic people are allergic to both. This means the “cat-free” and “dog-free” filter options only
      work for about 2.7% and 2.6% of the population. <strong>So, I decided just to show a “pet-free” option in the home filters</strong>.</p>

      <h3>List Order Prioritization</h3>
      <p>A recent infographic shows that there were about 3.3 million wheelchair users in U.S. in 2015, and the population of
      U.S. in 2015 is about 321.4 million. Therefore, the percentage of wheelchair users in the general population is less
      than 1%. This is dramatically less than the percentage of allergic population, which is about 10% as mentioned before.
      <strong>So, I decided to put “Pet-free” before “Wheelchair accessible”</strong>.</p>
    </div>

    <img class="content__img--no-padding" src="/images/original/portfolio/Pet-free-Home-Filter/FilterOrder2.png" alt="">

    <div class="project__content--with-padding">
    
      <h3>Iconography</h3>
      <p>Besides of home filters, another place to help people identify pet-free homes is on the home detail page. The existing
      design shows an “Amenities” list for each home, which includes things like TV, Wifi, Wheelchair accessible, etc. This is
      also a great place to add “Pet-free”, and the only missing part is an icon for “Pet-free” that matches the current icon
      style.</p>

      <h3>Prototyping & Usability Test</h3>
      <p>I would like to conduct following usability test if I had more time, and then iterate the designs based on the results:</p>
      
      <ol>
        <li>
          Book a pet-free home
        </li>
        <li>
          Confirm a given home is pet-free on its home detail page
        </li>
      </ol>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
  
      <p class="content__methods">
        <span class="content__method"></span>
      </p>
      
      <p>The pet-free home filter idea seemed like the least ambitious idea among the three. However, it is this kind of tiny
      improvement that makes a digital product more human and inclusive.</p>

      <p>The minority usually needs to do tons of extra work to stand on the same stage or to have the same rights as the
      majority. It is our designers responsibility to give more thoughtfulness and care to them.</p>
