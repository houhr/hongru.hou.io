Start reading books or something useful again.

Except for the two books that I translated, I nearly haven't added any new books to my douban.com reading list in the past half year. Every time when I log into douban.com, it is like I am stared by a child with eager eyes. Instead of giving Douban its due attention, I spend too much time on Weibo. To make things worse, Douban is not the only abandoned child. Google Reader, Prismatic, Pocket these "old friends" who accompanied me day and night are all left alone in a dark cold corner now.

There's an old saying somewhere, whose original version I've forgot, going like this: where you spend your time, where you harvest. How much have I harvested after spending numerous time on Weibo? Almost nothing.

It seems to be more and more obvious that Weibo is just like a bottomless jar for me, where everybody pours everything into it and nonstop. Weibo's short form, fast production, massive amount and the blundering atmosphere that Weibo creates are really doomed to distract us.

At the beginning, I thought those "must have tools", "powerful tools", "must know" and "Top ten â€¦" Weibos could provide me some shortcuts. But in fact, those information in some sense not only have no use in the most time, but also consumes our brain impression resources. Imaging that when nine tenth of a designer's Weibos include words "the best", are there any real "bests" exist? Even if they are indeed the best, they're only other people's best. If you are a man or woman with clear target and long-term plan, instead of letting others tell you "Hey, this is the best, remember to check it out!", you should know what're really the best things for you and where to seek for them. Don't let other people scream in front of you and rob your attention.

All in all, Weibo (and other micro blog) has its own merits, but comparing with books and blog articles, its input-output ratio is quite lower.
