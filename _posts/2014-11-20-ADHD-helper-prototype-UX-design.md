> Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a problem of not being able to focus, being overactive, not being able control behavior, or a combination of these.

— National Library of Medicine Website.

As a group of three graduate students, we were asked to create a helper tool to help people who has ADHD problem live a better and easier life. In order to know more about this problem which we had never heard before, we found a lady who had it. And we conducted an remote interview about her life and her ADHD problem. Following is the persona we abstracted from her.

## Persona

Katherine Jacobs, a 32 years old single woman, lives by herself in San Francisco. She has a job of barista at a cafe, and she’s also a nanny & a designer. She likes hiking, reading, and spending time with her close friends.

Katherine realized she had ADHD when she was 6 years old, because she had some difficulties about writing, setting priority(time management) and staying in focus. In order to make life easier, she takes Ritalin now after trying number of different medication. Medication can help her to move through tasks. Without medication, she’s tend to forget to look at her to-do list. Even with alarms she would put off the tasks and not do them.

Katherine likes her phone and computer, and apps like Reminder and Notes, which can help her stay organized. Other software such as Self Control can help her focus by blocking other informations around her.

## Define problem & brainstorm

According to the feedback of interview and the description of persona, we known that the reason of some negative effects like cannot set priorities or concentrate on writing is that the interviewee cannot stay in focus. And the core problem for that is distraction. And there are three main distractions: hearing distractions, visual distractions and psychological disturbance.  So these are the problems we could choose from to solve, and after a brainstorm, the potential solutions we came up include:

* Vibrating Necklace — helps the user to focus
* Wrist band notifier — helps the user to complete tasks on time
* Noise canceling headphones — helps the user to focus

## Storyboard

## Prototype I & bodystorm
We chose Vibrating Necklace as our plan. The main idea of this solution was that we hide a small camera inside the necklace, so if the usr move around, it will vibrate to remind the user to focus. We made our first camera prototype very fast, and the prototype could perfectly execute what we want it to do.

After we had our prototype I, we invited a stranger to do a bodystorm. Thought the bodystrom, we found our design has a big shortage — like if the user listen to a lecture, and if the speaker walk on the stage, the necklace will vibrate as well. Then, I came up with an idea of replace camera with motion sensor, and we can set the rotate speed and angle of the sensor, so it will only vibrate when user is distracted by something.

The stranger also give us a feedback that she don’t like wearing a necklace, but prefer a ear piece, because ear piece is much more convenient and casual than necklace. So, our prototype II is a ear piece with a motion sensor and vibration sensor.

## Prototype II & test

As the brain of the prototype, our Arduion Uno is kind of large and obviously we cannot put it on our ear. So, I customized four extreme long wire to connect the motion sensor and Arduino to facilitate the test process. And the following is a part of our testing process.

## Wrapping up

Even our prototype II is much better than prototype I, it’s still has some problem, such as when and how to vibrate so we can provide a better experience. And as our tester mentioned, she want so see a summarize of everyday’s distractions — these are all what we can do to improve the design. But as students, we have already learnt the basic process of interaction design, how to interview users and how to test our design. These are the most experience for us.
