As the last assignment of the Model Making class, we were asked to participate a real project — Art Proposal for the Bill Graham Auditorium. And the project description can be found [here](http://www.sfartscommission.org/pubartcollection/about-pubart/opportunities/2014/10/02/8637/).

## Explore background information
The building was a multi-purpose music hall, which named after music promoter Bill Graham. After went to the real location and familiarized its surrounding, I found the place was located at the heart of San Francisco and next to City Hall. One of its wall was mainly covered with dark shadow, cold wind and had nothing on it. The southwest corner of the building was kind of mess, and there were several homeless sleeping there.

## Define the problem
According to the purpose of the project and the background information I got, I think the problem of this place or the meaning of this project is how to balance different people’s lives. For the people inside the building — no matter they are singers or audience, they are tend to be the rich and have colorful lives. However, for the people who cannot enter the building or even sleep with the building every night, their lives need more color.

## Concept
The concept of this proposal is to reflect the color of real time traffic on the Polk Street by using thousands of full color range bulbs on the wall. On the one hand, the movement of jumping lights can represent people’s vivid lives around the build. On the other hand, the colorful animation also looks like a music visualizator, and this is how this piece of art connected to the Bill Graham Auditorium.

## Process
At beginning, I came up 4 sketches of how the LED lights or bulbs reflect the surrounding. After listened critics from classmates and discussed with professor, the final design was a solution which combined two of the sketches.

## Challenge
During the preparation of presenting the idea, the challenge for me was how to convert the 2D sketch into 3D prototype. Making the architecture model was easy, but how to present the moving traffic in a real way was kind of hard to achieve.

At the end of brainstorm with our professor Mark, he suggested me to show dynamic traffic by using projectors. I did some research about projecting things on real objects, and then understood what I need was named **3D projection**, which I had never done before. After spent several day’s effort on making video and mapping it on the model I made before, I finally turned my idea into reality. The effect of how I present my idea was quite intuitive, people can understand my idea instantly.
