## Choose a good typography (family)
* What kind of feeling do you want to convery?
* Do you need italic glyphs?
* Do you need bold glyphs?
* Do you need small caps?
* Do you need lowercase numerals?
* Does the typography has smart quotes and all the other punctuations you need, such as hyphen, en dash, and em dash?
* Do you know the history behind the typography?

## Implement a good typography
* Wrap all acronyms and abbreviations by using “abbr” element and give them appropriate “title” attributes.
* Apply small caps on acronyms and abbreviations if you have the font.
* Apply `white-space: nowrap` on last two or more words of every paragraphs to avoid “orphans”.
* Do you need track the small caps by using letter-spacing, especially when you have white texts on black background?

* hyphen: <kbd>-</kbd>
* en dash: <kbd><kbd>Option</kbd>+<kbd>-</kbd></kbd>
