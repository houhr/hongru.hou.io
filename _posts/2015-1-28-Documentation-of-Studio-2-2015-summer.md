title: Documentation of Studio 2 (2015 summer)
published: true
---
<p class="intro">Since a new semester has started, our Studio class got a new start and a new topic: Health and Well-being, which is a big topic that involves a huge range of things. And numerous opportunities are out there waiting for designers to explor. The following is the documentation of how we approached this topic from the very beginning.</p>

## Jan 23: Mapping the Territory of Health and Well-being

In order to have a rough idea of Health and Well-being and start from a specific point, our first week's work was to choose one of the research areas that related to the main topic and share the information in the class. The area I chose was *Wearable E-skins and Digestible Sensors*.

We are specially interested in following questions:

> * What are these technologies, how do they work, and what are the potential applications?
> * What is the state of these technologies?
> * What are they trying to address?
> * What are the potential benefits?
> * What are the ethical issues?

Here're the five kinds of technology I explored from **outside** to **inside** of our body:

### 1. Fundawear from Durex

Warning: The following video is kind of sort of NSFW.

> Fundawear is the world’s first wearable technology which allows personal touch to be transferred from a smartphone app to a partner anywhere in the world.<sup>[1]</sup>

The technology involved here is quite simple: by utilizing a mini sensors inside the Fundawear, after a smartphone receiveing touch gesture information from another one, it can control the motion sensor moving accordingly. The reason why I chose this example was I thought the electric underwear could be counted as both e-clothing and e-skin, which sitting at the most outside edge of the Wearable E-skins and Digestible Sensors spectrum.

### 2. Imperceptible electronics from University of Tokyo

The Imperceptible electronics is kind of “flexible sensor thinner than plastic wrap and lighter than a feather.”<sup>[2]</sup> According to its online introduction video, this ultra-thin e-skin is combined two micron foil and circuits with one micron plastic film. It's bendable, stretchable, and only 3g/m<sup>2</sup>. A layer of resistive tactile sensors and another layer of transistors are embedded in the circuits, so it can be applied in health monitoring system, wearable medical instruments and even robotic skin. It's also can be used to improve the comfort of today's cumbersome wearables for it's imperceptible characteristic. However, I'm worried about how to recycle this kind of material if it's been widely used, because “the material is nearly indestructible.”<sup>[2]</sup>

### 3. Attachable computers from MC10

As their names implied, the attachable computers are stamp-like small pieces technology which has “wireless antennas, temperature and heart-rate sensors and a tiny battery”<sup>[3]</sup> in them, and they will be worn on our skin. Because of these computers are tiny, thin, and closer to our body, so one of their advantages is less expensive cost but they still can collect users' biometric data. The potential benefits are countless, not only include medical apply like beauty company L’Oréal use it to track skin hydration<sup>[3]</sup>, but also can be used as user interface or even body art platform. In terms of concern, I'm worried about virus and hacking, because they are computers which live with us 7*24.

### 4. Digital Health Feedback System from Proteus Digital Health

This Digital Health Feedback System includes ingestible sensors which powered by human's stomach fluids completely and can send information, a body attached bluetooth patch which can receive information, and a mobile app where people can view their biometric data. The company announced that the system has been approved by FDA<sup>[4]</sup>. The mainly application of this system is body data monitoring. Because of the sensor will go inside our body, so the most common concern is privacy, like what kinds of data the sensor will collect and where it will send to.

### 5. Edible Silk Sensors from Tufts University

The edible sensor mentioned here is a fully chewable food sensor which made of gold antennae and silk film support. “Pasted onto eggs, stamped onto fruit or floating in milk, they can warn you when your fruit is ripe, or when your milk has gone sour.”<sup>[5]</sup> The reason why we can eat it is that the silk support is made of pure protein. And the technology behind the sensor is the gold sensor will detect the dielectric properties of food, and then send them out via RFID tech. Although they tested it on bananas, eggs, apples, cheese and milk, there still be cases it might not work. And because it used gold, it's hard for the technology being used in everyone's daily life.

## Jan 30: The Map & The Matrix (Information Architecture)

By means of “Process Flow Diagrams”, “Concept Maps”, “Contextualizing Design Models” and “Affinity Grouping / Card Sorting”<sup>[6]</sup>, our goal for this part is to reveal the infrastructure and eco-system of one of the products or services metioned above.

### Step 1. The creation of a concept matrix

### Step 2. Choose the right words

### Step 3. Illustrate the connections

### Step 4. Identify core concepts

### Step 5. Create concept map
