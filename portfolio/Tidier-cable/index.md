<p class="intro">Tidier cable is a web site where people can learn a skill of how to make their cables more tidier. The making process comes from one of traditional Chinese knots, and the challenge for designing and developing this site was how to convey the making process in a simple, elegant and cheerful way.</p>

In terms of a series of steps, a linear one page scrolling layout can present them quite well, because the user will never miss any steps. And by putting the indicators in the right middle of the page can bring two benefits: imply user to scroll down and represent the progress. In order to keep the whole page simple and clean, I chose to show brief instructions and related photos of every steps side by side, which can comunicate the information effectively.

<p class="full-width"><img class="shadow" src="/images/compressed/portfolio/Tidier-cable/2.jpg" title="Begin with a verb"></p>

Most of the instructions are begin with a verb, because verbs can invoke actions immediately. And for the content strategy, I used personification to add personality to the page and reduce the potential negative feeling of following instructions.

<p class="full-width"><img class="shadow" src="/images/compressed/portfolio/Tidier-cable/3.jpg" title="Typeface"></p>

I chose [Changa One](http://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Changa+One) from Google Fonts as the typeface of the page. The reason why I chose this font is that the curve of the typeface (like the “s” and the “g”) looks so similar with the curve that we can find in the knot. Besides that, the bold typeface can help to achieve visual balance when I put them on the white background. The color of the texts derived from the background color of the images.

In order to delight users and take emotion design into accourant, the tone of the voice of some instructions is a little bit funny. Moreover, I hided an easter egg in the last two steps — once users came to step #13 from step #12, they will hear a burst of applause, which will generate tremendous of cheerful atmosphere at the very end.
