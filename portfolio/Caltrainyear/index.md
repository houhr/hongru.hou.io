<p class="intro">Caltrainyear was a data visualization project which contains two phases — create a poster with any
Caltrain data and then transplant the same information into an interactive version on Apple watch. </p>

## Design the poster

I did three versions of posters in total. After brainstormed with some data of Caltrain locomotives, I came up a new direction and coined a new term — Caltrainyear. The idea was from light-year, which means the distance of how long light can go during one year. So, Caltrainyear means the distance of how long a Caltrain can go during one year. In order to make the concept more clear and interesting, I used the distance between real places to show how many Caltrainyears they are from one place to another. Following images show the ideation and iteration route I went through.

## Challenge of moving from 2D to 4D
The challenge of turing the Caltrainyear poster into an interactive version was how to distribute information based on time, especially turning it into an Apple watch app.

The disadvantage of Apple watch is the screen size is very limited, but its advantage is the digital crown is very useful to browse a list. So, the main idea of the interactive version is to show necessary concept and formula of *Caltrainyear* first, then let users browse a place list which contain all three parts of the places in the poster.

Besides of changing the information structure for Apple watch, another thing I added was to give users a option to use their own speed to calculate Caltrainyear if they were on a running Caltrain, which I think can increase the interesting of the app. After all, a watch app has more context we can utilize than a poster's.

The first version of interaction design was quite linear — open the app, choose a speed, understand the concept and start to explore. The problem of this version was it took three taps to show the core data. So, in order to bring the core data forward, I moved the speed option into the context menu (use force touch to show it) when browsing data, because choosing speed is not a key touch point on the using route. Following flow chart shows the improved version of interaction design.

## Prototype

I made a low fidelity prototype by using Keynote, which I think is enough to test the interaction design above. In terms of using Keynote to make prototype, the most useful features in Keynote are Magic Move, Scale, Disappear and Dissolve. And sometimes, it may still tricky to create UI parts for Keynote prototype. You are welcome to [check out the Keynote prototype file](/portfolio/Caltrainyear/prototype-v2.key.zip) of this project.
