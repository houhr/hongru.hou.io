<p>NextMuni is a Muni arrival times prediction app that knows what you want based on where you are and what you have searched before when you were there. And then, show you the right data without any further effort. And of course, there's more information if you want to dig.</p>

<p>On the way to or at a Muni station? Keep calm and give your Apple watch a glance. It can even guide you to the station if you need.</p>

## Why I designed NextMuni / Pain point
The existing Muni arrival times prediction apps are not smart enough and lacking of enough customized information for the individual. Therefore, people need spend much time and do multiple taps (which are not necessary) to find the right information they want.

## Project concept

### Design goal
Simplify the connection between people's **personal** needs and the right information; helping people live a more **efficient** life.

### Opportunity
After grouping and saving the data of where and when did people use the app and which kind of public transit information they looked for, we can reduce the time and effort that people need to spend by guessing what people want via query history and showing the data positively.

## Research
Research can help us build a better understanding of both user's and app's context, as well as how they will interact with each other.

### Target users
The target user of this kind of apps is person who has a relatively fixed daily routine — go back and forth between home and school or company — and taking public transit every weekday. They know which bus they should take and where the station is, or they can get this information from other prepositive apps like Google Maps. So, there's a app ecosystem exist for public transit prediciton apps.
